She is an unpleasant and pushy woman and none of her own daughters have allowed her near them when they gave birth. My sisters-in-law are all at least twelve years older than my husband and are all done having kids. I am the last chance for my mother-in-law to see the birth of a grandchild.\n\nI have zero interest in letting that judgemental old woman see me down there. She has objected to me from the beginning because I have tattoos and am not in any way interested in being a stay at home wife. I have a lot of tattoos and a career I plan on continuing. And I have tattoos down there that are none of her business.\n\nMy husband is her baby boy. He is a good husband and has stood up for me against her many times. When she tried to interfere with our wedding he put his foot down. When she tried to convince him that we should move to his hometown where he could work from but I would not be able to find an employer in my line of work he said no because my career is important to me and, while we can live off of his earnings and the cost of living is lower in his home town, our combined earnings are much better all together.\n\nShe has started crying to him that all she wants is to see a grandchild being born. All her friends have experienced it and she wants it. He is starting to crumble under her emotional blackmail.\n\nSo I made it clear that the only way I would agree was if, before the birth, my husband made arrangements for my father to witness him getting a colonoscopy. He would need a ride anyways so two birds one stone you know. He said I'm being ridiculous but I said none of my brothers would let my dad see them getting a camera shoved up their ass and he felt left out.\n\nHe finally understood my point but his mother is upset that I used such a stupid comparison. She says that it isn't the same thing at all. I offered to change it to me watching her get a Brazilian wax and she hasn't called in a week.\n\nI know seeing a baby being born might be her dream but I am not interested.\n\nAITA?", "title": "AITA for telling my husband that he has to let my dad witness his colonoscopy?", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AITAH", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "ups": 21470, "score": 21470, "thumbnail": "self", "is_self": true, "created_utc": 1701864512.0, "num_comments": 4351, "permalink": "/r/AITAH/comments/18c2li1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_has_to_let_my/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18c2li1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_has_to_let_my/", "is_video": false, "subreddit": "AITAH", "author": "ReadyPreparation5472"}, {"selftext": "He's 23.
