I feel like crap for it but I completely forgot. I was so terrified that my older son would die that I couldn\u2019t think of much else.

My ex and I had no clue what he was talking about but we assumed my ex\u2019s sister must\u2019ve done something for him and said we had a hand in it.\n\nI just found out that it wasn\u2019t my ex\u2019s sister, it was his girlfriend. She baked a really cool cake for him, bought him a new gaming chair and headset that he wanted, and took it to him on his birthday saying they were from me and my ex. She even wrote a card in the POV of me and his dad and signed off saying \u201cnever forget how much we love you - mum and dad\u201d. \n\nI asked my ex if he told her to do that but he said he didn\u2019t even know she had, and that she never mentioned it. \n\nNow I\u2019m crying.
